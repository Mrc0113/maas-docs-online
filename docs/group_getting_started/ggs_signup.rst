Creating Your First Messaging Service
=====================================

To start integrating your applications with Solace PubSub+ Cloud, you must first create a messaging service. Once your messaging service is created, you can connect your applications with it
by using a client library compatible with the Solace PubSub+ message broker. This getting started tutorial will walk you through creating an account on Solace PubSub+ Cloud,
creating your first messaging service, and obtaining the connection information necessary to get your applications connected to Solace PubSub+ Cloud.

If you are new to **Messaging**, you may wish to first read :doc:`../group_concepts/gc_messaging_concepts`.

Otherwise, let's get started. You can skip to `step 2`_  if you already have an account. This should not take more than **2 minutes** and will only require a web browser.

Step 2: Create a messaging service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tip:** When logged in you will be brought to the My Services page. This page will show you all the messaging services you have created in Solace PubSub+ Cloud. 

**Create your first messaging service**
1. Press the Create Service button.
2. You must then select a **plan type**
   **Tip:** For your first messaging service, select the **Free Plan** or **Nano** depending on your account setup.
3. Enter a **service name**
4. Choose the **cloud provider and region** for your messaging service by selecting the map and choosing from the available    providers and regions.
5. Enter a messaging service name of **My First Service**. 
6. Press the **Start Service** button to complete the process.
7.The service will be created and the Service Details page will be displayed. 
**Tip:** Solace PubSub+ Cloud gives you access to different plan types that will give various levels of messaging performance. By default, a new Solace PubSub+ Cloud account only has access to the free plan. Later on, you may request access to additional plans by selecting them and pressing the request access button.
**Tip:** If the region you prefer isn't available, you can contact Solace PubSub+ Cloud support and ask for your region to be supported. For your first messaging service, choose the region closest to where your application will run.
